# hello-world
Hopefully the first of many.....we will see.

I went back to school at the age of 37. I'm going to be 40 in July 2017. Crazy to think. I originally was studying software engineering but took a class with circuits and loved it so I switched to embedded systems because I can still program and work with digital circuits. I felt that if I stuck with just software, I would be more difficult to go the hardware route where with embedded, I'm still programming. I will graduate in 2020. I have four children and have been married for seven years. My wife is very supportive of what I'm doing and that helps a lot because this is not easy trying to juggle work, family, and school. 

I've only been programming for a year and a half. I've programmed in C,C++ and C#. However, the only things that I have done are for class assignments and I wanted to start branching out and attempt to write my own stuff, even if it sucks.
